Born c. 1970s-1980s 

(F#1) Taylor Swift: 

Yeah, okay, basically fuck what everybody says: Taylor Swift is a genius. 

Jason Bateman: Yeah, George Gershwin was okay. But Taylor Swift is a genius. She blows my fucking mind. 

Juno MacGuff: *jumping up and down on a couch* 'Cause baby if you love like that, *your blood runs cold!*

Right. 

Molotov: *with obvious glee* Hey, who is that guy! I don't much like the look of him, myself! 

Gershwin: *leans in* I hate being privileged. 

Molotov: *boyishly* We're among friends, Georgy! 

*later* 

Molotov: It is customary for the workers to enjoy ice cream....

Gershwin: (gritting his teeth) I hate this part. 

Molotov: .... And it is also customary, for the committee to choose the flavor by lot. 

George Gershwin: *Oh my fucking god. Thank god.* 

Freedom in a country that's racist, you know, *bad*. Bad blood. Blood runneth cold. 

Born c. 1990s

*I'm so upset. It's not fair. It's not fair. You shouldn't tell God tell God that's not fair, but I'm telling a God that it's not fair, what they did, to Peter Tchaikovsky. It isn't right. It isn't right. 

He tried. He tried, and he failed. He tried to be GOOD-- "fixing a hole in the ocean"-- and he failed, didn't he. Didn't he. He did. He wasn't good. He wasn't good. He wanted to be good, more than ANY OF THE OTHERS.... It's not right. It's not right. It's not fair. 

I don't want to even use this WEB SITE, anymore, this is, Trauma.... It shouldn't be possible. It shouldn't be possible. It shouldn't be possible. Shouldn't be. Shouldn't be.... 

"Nothing is real." 

I don't know; it's harder to trust.... It doesn't make sense. 

Have mercy on Peter Tchaikovsky. 

You have to be good, or not. You keep your soul.... Or give it away. But he, he.... He wanted.... But he didn't. 

If you take it on yourself, and you fail: what happens. Please God don't tell me. 

It's your duty until a point: be careful. Be careful. 

"Help. I need somebody. Help. Not just anybody...." 

Young Love: If you get caught out in the storm, it's alright.... 

Have mercy on Peter. I would help him if I could, for I know that I am worse than he. 

Young Love: IF YOU GET LOST ALONG THE WAY, IT'S ALL RIGHT. 

It just wasn't possible. It was too hard.

I am Hermes: I am a very small god. I am not Hitler, nor a bug.

Take me, far from it, please. Please. Ah....

O Stalin, do not let them win. I am not Stalin.

I do not want to be a white raven: it is hard. It is too hard. It is not possible, what has happened. 

They did not lie to me: nothing is real.

I know that the man Haydn felt a fear he did not earn, but I will not ask You about him, since it wrong to complain to You about what I do not understand. But not to complain about what You ought to want to do to our god Peter Pan for what he has done, is a duty I cannot perform.

He was only trying to eat his soup with a napkin, like a child. He was not good. I do not call him good. Please.... DO NOT ANALYZE IT. I ask this, yes: I pray you grant it, anyway.... So little is truly ambiguous. It is madness. Please, let this be that....

Taylor Swift had to dress like the others, for the others.... So had to be bad for them, because she is good.... We are not good.... We are not good. Please she is like my sister I do not say that it makes sense or that we are different from the aboriginals. 

If you get the chance, you must dance, dance, dance....

If you get the chance, if you get the chance, if you get the chance, oh, if you get the chance....

Great gods guide us, as we find another way to dance....

I do not know where we should have drawn the line, but clearly we did not. We are not good. I do not say that we are good. 

Bless the guitar that lessens our sin, o old ones, o great ones.... Let them after me feel it less....

I don't know where the line is supposed to be, like it makes, but I don't want to lose my mind.

I don't want to try to be Peter, and see Satan. As if it would make sense if....

As if it would ever make sense.*
